        Cornell University. While in college, I have learned how to code in Python, Java, and
        most recently OCaml. In order to create this webite, I taught myself a little
        bit of HTML along with some CSS over the summer. Attatched I have included my
        resume along with some of my projects so that I can keep track of all of the
        work I have been doing.
